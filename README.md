# dataminig_project

## Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** (handling missing values, formatting, consistency)
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends (customer demographics, booking patterns)
- Derive **actionable insights** such as peak booking seasons, customer preferences, and repeat guest behaviors
- Present findings clearly in both visual (charts, graphs) and written forms for stakeholders

## Dataset Details
- Format: Excel (`.xlsx`)
- Contents: Guest demographics, booking dates, length of stay, room types, cancellation status, etc. *(Update specifics as needed)*

## Analysis Highlights
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed incomplete entries, standardized date formats, removed duplicates
- **Trends Observed**: Charted seasonal booking fluctuations, peak occupancy periods, customer origins
- **Segment Analysis**: Identified key customer groups like repeat vs new guests, domestic vs international
- **Recommendations**: Suggested optimal staffing periods, targeted promotions, and improvements in booking strategies
